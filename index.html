    <p>
      If you have never had a croissant before, boy are you in for a treat!
      Croissants are a classic French pastry, rolled and shaped into a crescent.
      They’re light and airy, and so buttery, with a hint of sweetness and a
      little bit of a yeasty, stretchy texture. There’s nothing else quite like
      a croissant! And when you make them yourself, from wholesome ingredients
      like real butter and milk, they are completely out of this world. You
      won’t believe how delicious croissants can be when you’ve taken the time
      to make them with your own two hands
